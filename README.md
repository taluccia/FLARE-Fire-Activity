# FLARE-Fire-Activity

## Overview
This repository contains scripts for processing spatial data to develop a fire perimeter database for 8 ecozones across Northeastern Siberia and characterize fire activity

The paper can be found here

## Process

1. Process ecozone shapefile boundaries to upload as assets to GEE (Google Earth Engine)

2. Process Hotspot (i.e., thermal detection data) from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; 2001-present) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite; 2011-present). Data was acquire for Russia from [FIRMS](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/download/create.php)
