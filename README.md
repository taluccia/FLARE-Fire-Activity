The paper can be found here

## Process

1. Process ecozone shapefile boundaries to upload as assets to GEE (Google Earth Engine)

2. Process Hotspot (i.e., thermal detection data) from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; November 2000-present), VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite; January 2012-present), and VIIRS NOAA-20 375 m data is available from January 2020-present.
